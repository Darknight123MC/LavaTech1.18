                  "text": "The heated compressor is capable of producing many useful resources by using heat generated in a lava vent to compress materials further and more efficiently than is normally possible. However, such a machine is very expensive as a result. The machine must be placed on top of a lava vent in order to receive heat. The heated compressor uses 20FE/tick for every unit of heat provided by its lava vent."
