Higher $(thing)heat$() increase the speed at which machines work but also how much energy they consume. A machine powered by 4 lava sources will work twice as fast as one powered by 2 lava sources, but will also use twice as much FE/tick.$(br)NOTE: Heat sources don't get consumed over time, so you do not need to replace lava sources."
